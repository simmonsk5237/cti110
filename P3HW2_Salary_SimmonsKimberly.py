Pseudocode:
1. Ask user to enter employee name.
2. Ask user to enter number of hours worked this week.
3. Ask user to enter employee's pay rate.
4. If hours worked > 40:
   a. Calculate overtime hours = hours worked - 40
   b. Calculate overtime pay = overtime hours * pay rate * 1.5
   c. Calculate regular pay = 40 * pay rate
5. Else:
   a. Overtime hours = 0
   b. Overtime pay = 0
   c. Regular pay = hours worked * pay rate
6. Gross pay = regular pay + overtime pay
